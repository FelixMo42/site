# Super Link
Super Link is an online platform for making anything that connects variables, from a+b to a's inverse mod b.

### ABOUT

Super Link is a website created by Felix Moses, Milo Moses, Addison Sutton, Parker Sutton for HS Hacks IV. Its a web application that lets you link variable together in a web and it will automatically solve for all missing variable it can. The backend was build using Flask (A python library for web site back end development), letting it handle arbitrarily large numbers. It has a wide array of application, ranging from RSA, to figuring out you mile time in different units.

### HOW TO USE

There are two major things in this application: variables and links. To create a variable press new variable and type in the name. You will see this creates a variable in the work area, by typing in the text box you can change its value any time. A link is a connection between two or more variables. E.g. adding a link says that variable 1 + variable 2 = variable 3. Super Link will automatically fill in variable it can deduce from your inputs and the links. It you create a new link with non created variable it will automatically create them. You can delete or edit a link by right-clicking on it, and similarly you can rename or delete a variable by delete-right-clicking on it. Have fun!
